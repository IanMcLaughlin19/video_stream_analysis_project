* Want to get it full running in docker
* Want to get live generating videos going
* Look into ways to programatically receive the stream and analyze the video
* Good starting point "Using WebGear_RTC with a Custom Source(OpenCV)" part of https://abhitronix.github.io/vidgear/v0.2.2-stable/gears/webgear_rtc/advanced/
    * It seems to be manipualting the frames - can we instead replace the frames to do live generating?
